        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
            At approximately 9:15 PM, officers responded to a reported armed robbery at Green Leaf Market, a corner store located at 2345 Regent Street. Witnesses reported that an individual, later identified as Evan Sage, entered the store, brandished a weapon, and demanded cash from the register. No injuries were reported.

        <h4>Details of Incident</h4>
        <p>
            Upon entering the store, Sage approached the counter, allegedly pulling out what appeared to be a firearm and instructing the cashier to empty the register. Witnesses indicated that Sage was wearing a dark hoodie and a black mask, making immediate identification difficult. However, surveillance footage captured clear images of Sage’s features after he briefly removed his mask while speaking with the cashier.

            Store employees noted that Sage appeared calm but was “insistent and hurried.” The cashier complied with his demands and handed over an estimated $400 in cash. Sage left the store on foot, fleeing northbound toward Regent Street. The incident took no longer than three minutes, according to witness statements.

        <h4>Investigation and Evidence</h4>
        <p>
            Upon review of the store’s security footage, detectives were able to positively identify the suspect as Evan Sage, a 24-year-old resident of Madison. Fingerprints lifted from the counter matched records linked to Sage from prior minor infractions. Madison PD has issued a warrant for his arrest.
